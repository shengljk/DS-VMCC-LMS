# DS-VMCC-LMS
Title of the paper: ‘Robust data-selective nonlinear system identification based on Volterra model’.

This thesis is divided into two types of experiments: system identification and acoustic echo cancellation.
All the algorithms involved in the simulation part of the paper: VLMS, SM-VLMS, DS-Jeong-VLMS, MCCDS-VLMS, DS-VMCC-VLMS correspond to the code files Volterra_LMS1.m, SM_Volterra_LMS.m, DS_d1_Volterra_LMS.m, MCC_Volterra_LMS. MCC_Volterra_LMS.m, DS_VMCC_Volterra_LMS.m.

There are two main files in the system identification experiment, where main1 and main2 are the main code files for Gaussian white input and AR2 input, respectively.

BG_Noise.m is the code used to generate impulse noise.

Please refer to the original article for all experimental parameter settings. The runtime environment is Matlab2022a. thank you for your patience in reading!
